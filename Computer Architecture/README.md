## About
This is my computer architecture course project.

We assume that an ARM microcontroller is taking responsibilities of a smart home.
there are some sensors connected to the microcontroller and it should react to values reported 
by the sensors considering the range of values. Finally, the microcontroller sets and resets
some values that resemble functionalities like turning the air conditioner on or off, adjusting 
the lights, etc.
